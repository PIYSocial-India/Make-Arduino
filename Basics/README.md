# What is Arduino
- Arduino is an open-source electronics platform based on easy-to-use hardware and software.
- Arduino consists of both a physical programmable circuit board (often referred to as a microcontroller) and a piece of software, or IDE (Integrated Development Environment) that runs on your computer, used to write and upload computer code to the physical board.
- Arduino has wide range of applications, starting from blinking a LED to automatically sending texts in Twitter.
